// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// CORRECT ORDER:
// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = 'This is the second step, in which the requirements of what is needed is being determined. For example, developers will ask if there is a need for a payment system, authentication for an application, do users need to login and logout, or what kind of data is needed to be tracked.'

const design = 'This is the third step, in which the developers will determine the best technologies, data structures, database, language, frameworks, and other tools that are appropriate to help with the making and solving of the requirements (from the previous step).'

const implementation = 'This is the fourth step, in which a solid team will start coding and building the project (applications, websites, etc.).'

const testingAndIntegration = 'This is the fifth step, in which the project (application, website, etc.) is tested to see if it is functioning correctly to minimize bugs and errors. Once ready, the team will release the application for the public users.'

const maintain = 'This is the sixth step, in which developers will need to pay attention to fix bugs and errors that were found by users. By fixing the bugs and errors, the application will be maintained properly and run smoothly.'
